Recipe for building a KOKKOS-compatible lammps.

Start on cottontail2:

```sh
cd /share/apps/CENTOS8/ohpc/software/lammps/1Jan2025/src
git clone -b develop https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git .

cd src
make yes-colloid
make yes-class2
make yes-kspace
make yes-misc
make yes-molecule
make yes-ml-pace
make yes-reaction
make yes-mc 
make yes-fep
make yes-extra-pair
make yes-extra-fix
make yes-extra-compute
make yes-manybody
make yes-asphere
make lib-lepton args="-m mpi"
```

apc and voronoi failed to build (so get rid of them). 
All others loaded okay. 

Normally we would copy the src directory to 
`/share/apps/CENTOS8/ohpc/software/lammps/1Jan2025/`

but it's already there. Now let's build:
```sh
cd STUBS
make
cd ..
```

I make the following revisions to `MAKE/Makefile.serial`:

```sh
LMP_INC =       -DLAMMPS_GZIP -DLAMMPS_MEMALIGN=64  -DLAMMPS_JPEG  
JPG_INC =   -I/usr/include
JPG_PATH =  -L/usr/lib64
JPG_LIB =   -ljpeg
```
and then run
```sh
 make -j4 serial
```
So far so good. 

Then I edit `MAKE/Makefile.mpi` and make the following changes:

```sh
LMP_INC =       -DLAMMPS_GZIP -DLAMMPS_MEMALIGN=64  -DLAMMPS_JPEG  
JPG_INC =   -I/usr/include
JPG_PATH =  -L/usr/lib64
JPG_LIB =   -ljpeg 
```
These are all the same changes as we did to  MAKE/Makefile.serial, but there's two more:
```sh
CCFLAGS =       -g -O3 -std=c++11 -fopenmp
LINKFLAGS =     -g -O3 -std=c++11 -fopenmp
```
With these edits in place, run
```sh
 make -j4 mpi
```
If there are no errors, now I go to a compute node (I used n110). 
```sh
module load cuda/12.6
which nvcc
```
this prints:
```sh
/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin/nvcc
```
There's one more workaround we need. 
For some reason we need to relaod mpicxx like so:

```sh
module reload openmpi4/4.1.1  ### work around, thanks Henk!
```
With this working, we add gpu and kokkos packages:
```sh
make yes-gpu
make yes-kokkos
```

Now copy and set some environment variables:
```sh
cp MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.kokkos_cuda_mpi MAKE/
set SKX,ADA89, -fopenmp
```

I then edit MAKE/Makefile.kokkos_cuda_mpi and make the following edits:

```sh
LMP_INC =       -DLAMMPS_GZIP -DLAMMPS_MEMALIGN=64  -DLAMMPS_JPEG   -DKokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP=on
JPG_INC =   -I/usr/include
JPG_PATH =  -L/usr/lib64
JPG_LIB =   -ljpeg 
```

With these edits in place, go back to the parent directory and change GPU information:

```sh
cd ..
scp -rp lib/gpu lib/gpu-orig
cd lib/gpu/
```

I make the following changes to Makefile.linux:

```sh
CUDA_ARCH = -arch=sm_89
CUDA_PRECISION = -D_DOUBLE_DOUBLE
```
Also be sure CUDA_HOME is set to /usr/local/cuda which is a symlink pointing to cuda-12.6.

Lastly, run:
```sh
make -f Makefile.linux
```
